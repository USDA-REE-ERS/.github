## Economic Research Service <br>U.S. Department of Agriculture

### **The mission of USDA's Economic Research Service is to anticipate trends and emerging issues in agriculture, food, the environment, and rural America and to conduct high-quality, objective economic research to inform and enhance public and private decision making.**

ERS shapes its research program and products to serve those who routinely make or influence public policy and program decisions. Key clientele include White House and USDA policy officials; the U.S. Congress; program administrators/managers; other Federal agencies; State and local government officials; and organizations, including farm and industry groups. ERS research provides context for and informs the decisions that affect the agricultural sector, which in turn benefits everyone with efficient stewardship of our agricultural resources and the economic prosperity of the sector.

As a federal statistical agency covered by the <a href='https://www.ers.usda.gov/about-ers/policies-and-standards/omb-statistical-policy-directives'>Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) Statistical Policy Directives<a/>, ERS is responsible for ensuring the quality, objectivity, and transparency of the statistical information it provides.
